        <h4>ACCESS BY CHILDREN</h4>
        <p> In the United States, if you are a device manufacturer or other third party (the "Sponsor") that provides devices to children under the age of 13 that utilize the Pocket Technologies, you assume the responsibility for complying with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") and, to the extent applicable, The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"). This means that the Sponsor must notify parents/guardians of the information to be collected and obtain parental/guardian consent before collecting and sharing with the Pocket application the personal information of children under the age of 13 in order to establish an account or use the Pocket Technologies. Schools may under appropriate circumstances provide such consent on behalf of parents/guardians. For more information on complying with COPPA, see the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/coppafaqs.shtm. </p>
        <p> Except as provided in the paragraph above, the Pocket Technologies are not for individuals under the age of 13. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to it. </p>
