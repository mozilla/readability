            <p> Once you have mastered the art of mutable history in a single repository (see the <a href="http://fakehost/test/user-guide.html">user guide</a>), you can move up to the next level: <em>shared</em> mutable history. <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> lets you push and pull draft changesets between repositories along with their obsolescence markers. This opens up a number of interesting possibilities. </p>
            <p> The simplest scenario is a single developer working across two computers. Say you’re working on code that must be tested on a remote test server, probably in a rack somewhere, only accessible by SSH, and running an “enterprise-grade” (out-of-date) OS. But you probably prefer to write code locally: everything is setup the way you like it, and you can use your preferred editor, IDE, merge/diff tools, etc. </p>
            <p> Traditionally, your options are limited: either </p>
            <blockquote>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(ab)use your source control system by committing half-working code in order to get it onto the remote test server, or </li>
                        <li>go behind source control’s back by using <tt><span>rsync</span></tt> (or similar) to transfer your code back-and-forth until it is ready to commit </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </blockquote>
            <p> The former is less bad with distributed version control systems like Mercurial, but it’s still far from ideal. (One important version control “best practice” is that every commit should make things just a little bit better, i.e. you should never commit code that is worse than what came before.) The latter, avoiding version control entirely, means that you’re walking a tightrope without a safety net. One accidental <tt><span>rsync</span></tt> in the wrong direction could destroy hours of work. </p>
            <p> Using Mercurial with <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> to share mutable history solves these problems. As with single-repository <tt><span>evolve</span></tt>, you can commit whenever the code is demonstrably better, even if all the tests aren’t passing yet—just <tt><span>hg</span> <span>amend</span></tt> when they are. And you can transfer those half-baked changesets between repositories to try things out on your test server before anything is carved in stone. </p>
            <p> A less common scenario is multiple developers sharing mutable history, typically for code review. We’ll cover this scenario later. First, we will cover single-user sharing. </p>

                    <p> The key to shared mutable history is to keep your changesets in <em>draft</em> phase as you pass them around. Recall that by default, <tt><span>hg</span> <span>push</span></tt> promotes changesets from <em>draft</em> to <em>public</em>, and public changesets are immutable. You can change this behaviour by reconfiguring the <em>remote</em> repository so that it is non-publishing. (Short version: set <tt><span>phases.publish</span></tt> to <tt><span>false</span></tt>. Long version follows.) </p>

                    <p> We’ll work through an example with three local repositories, although in the real world they’d most likely be on three different computers. First, the <tt><span>public</span></tt> repository is where tested, polished changesets live, and it is where you synchronize with the rest of your team. </p>
                    <p> We’ll need two clones where work gets done, <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>: </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <pre>$ hg clone public test-repo

0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved

                    <p>
                        <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> is your local machine, with GUI merge tools and IDEs and everything configured just the way you like it. <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> is the test server in a rack somewhere behind SSH. So for the most part, we’ll develop in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, push to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>, test and polish there, and push to <tt><span>public</span></tt>. </p>
                    <p> The key to shared mutable history is to make the target repository, in this case <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>, non-publishing. And, of course, we have to enable the <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> extension in both <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>. </p>
                    <p> First, edit the configuration for <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>: </p>

                    <p> This process can repeat. Perhaps you figure out a more elegant fix to the bug, and want to mutate history so nobody ever knows you had a less-than-perfect idea. We’ll implement it locally in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> and push to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>: </p>
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <p> This time around, the temporary amend commit is in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, and it is not transferred to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>—the same as before, just in the opposite direction. Figure 4 shows the two repositories after amending in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> and pushing to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> [figure SG04: each repo has one temporary amend commit, but they’re different in each one] </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> Let’s hop over to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to test the more elegant fix: </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <pre>$ cd ../test-repo
$ hg update
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
</pre>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p> This time, all the tests pass, so no further amending is required. This bug fix is finished, so we push it to the public repository: </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <pre>$ hg push
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
</pre>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p> Note that only one changeset—the final version, after two amendments—was actually pushed. Again, Mercurial doesn’t transfer hidden changesets on push and pull. </p>
                    <p> So the picture in <tt><span>public</span></tt> is much simpler than in either <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> or <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>. Neither of our missteps nor our amendments are publicly visible, just the final, beautifully polished changeset: </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> [figure SG05: public repo with rev 0:0dc9, 1:de61, both public] </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> There is one important step left to do. Because we pushed from <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to <tt><span>public</span></tt>, the pushed changeset is in <em>public</em> phase in those two repositories. But <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> has been out-of-the-loop; changeset de61 is still <em>draft</em> there. If we’re not careful, we might mutate history in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, obsoleting a changeset that is already public. Let’s avoid that situation for now by pushing up to <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>: </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <pre>$ hg push ../dev-repo

                    <p> Even though no <em>changesets</em> were pushed, Mercurial still pushed obsolescence markers and phase changes to <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>. </p>
                    <p> A final note: since this fix is now <em>public</em>, it is immutable. It’s no longer possible to amend it: </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>

                    </div>
                    <p> This is, after all, the whole point of Mercurial’s phases: to prevent rewriting history that has already been published. </p>

                <p> Now that you know how to share your own mutable history across multiple computers, you might be wondering if it makes sense to share mutable history with others. It does, but you have to be careful, stay alert, and <em>communicate</em> with your peers. </p>
                <p> Code review is a good use case for sharing mutable history across multiple developers: Alice commits a draft changeset, submits it for review, and amends her changeset until her reviewer is satisfied. Meanwhile, Bob is also committing draft changesets for review, amending until his reviewer is satisfied. Once a particular changeset passes review, the respective author (Alice or Bob) pushes it to the public (publishing) repository. </p>
                <p> Incidentally, the reviewers here can be anyone: maybe Bob and Alice review each other’s work; maybe the same third party reviews both; or maybe they pick different experts to review their work on different parts of a large codebase. Similarly, it doesn’t matter if reviews are conducted in person, by email, or by carrier pigeon. Code review is outside of the scope of Mercurial, so all we’re looking at here is the mechanics of committing, amending, pushing, and pulling. </p>

                <p> Two other types of troubles can happen: <em>divergent</em> and <em>bumped</em> changesets. Both are more likely with shared mutable history, especially mutable history shared by multiple developers. </p>

                    <p> If Alice and Bob are collaborating on some mutable changesets, it’s possible to get into a situation where an otherwise worthwhile changeset cannot be pushed to the public repository; it is <em>phase-divergent</em> with another changeset that was made public first. Let’s demonstrate one way this could happen. </p>
                    <p> It starts with Alice committing a bug fix. Right now, we don’t yet know if this bug fix is good enough to push to the public repository, but it’s good enough for Alice to commit. </p>

But in Alice’s repository (and the <tt><span>public</span></tt> repository), that changeset is public: it is immutable, carved in stone for all eternity. No changeset can be both obsolete and public, so Bob is in for a surprise the next time he pulls from <tt><span>public</span></tt>: </p>

                    <p> Figure 7 shows what just happened to Bob’s repository: changeset 2:e011 is now public, so it can’t be obsolete. When that changeset was obsolete, it made perfect sense for it to have a successor, namely Bob’s amendment of Alice’s fix (changeset 4:fe88). But it’s illogical for a public changeset to have a successor, so 4:fe88 is troubled: it has become <em>bumped</em>. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> [figure SG07: 2:e011 now public not obsolete, 4:fe88 now bumped] </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p> As usual when there’s trouble in your repository, the solution is to evolve it: </p>
                    <p> Figure 8 illustrates Bob’s repository after evolving away the bumped changeset. Ignoring the obsolete changesets, Bob now has a nice, clean, simple history. His amendment of Alice’s bug fix lives on, as changeset 5:227d—albeit with a software-generated commit message. (Bob should probably amend that changeset to improve the commit message.) But the important thing is that his repository no longer has any troubled changesets, thanks to <tt><span>evolve</span></tt>. </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p> [figure SG08: 5:227d is new, formerly bumped changeset 4:fe88 now hidden] </p>

                <p> Mutable history is a powerful tool. Like a sharp knife, an experienced user can do wonderful things with it, much more wonderful than with a dull knife (never mind a rusty spoon). At the same time, an inattentive or careless user can do harm to himself or others. Mercurial with <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> goes to great lengths to limit the harm you can do by trying to handle all possible types of “troubled” changesets. Nevertheless, having a first-aid kit nearby does not mean you should stop being careful with sharp knives. </p>
                <p> Mutable history shared across multiple repositories by a single developer is a natural extension of this model. Once you are used to using a single sharp knife on its own, it’s pretty straightforward to chop onions and mushrooms using the same knife, or to alternate between two chopping boards with different knives. </p>
                <p> Mutable history shared by multiple developers is a scary place to go. Imagine a professional kitchen full of expert chefs tossing their favourite knives back and forth, with the occasional axe or chainsaw thrown in to spice things up. If you’re confident that you <em>and your colleagues</em> can do it without losing a limb, go for it. But be sure to practice a lot first before you rely on it! </p>
