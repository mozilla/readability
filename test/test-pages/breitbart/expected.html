        <h2><span>Snopes fact checker and staff writer David Emery posted to Twitter asking if there were “any un-angry Trump supporters?”</span></h2>
        <p><span>Emery, a writer for partisan “fact-checking” website Snopes.com which soon will be in charge of labelling </span><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/12/15/facebook-introduce-warning-labels-stories-deemed-fake-news/"><span>“fake news”</span></a><span> alongside ABC News and Politifact, retweeted an article by Vulture magazine relating to the </span><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/11/19/boycotthamilton-trends-hamilton-cast-members-harass-mike-pence/"><span>protests</span></a><span> of the <em>Hamilton</em> musical following the decision by the cast of the show to make a </span><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2016/11/19/tolerance-hamilton-cast-lectures-mike-pence-broadway-stage/"><span>public announcement</span></a><span> to Vice-president elect Mike Pence while he watched the performance with his family.</span></p>

        <p><span>The tweet from Vulture magazine reads, “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hamilton?src=hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>#Hamilton</span></a><span> Chicago show interrupted by angry Trump supporter.” Emery retweeted the story, saying, “Are there un-angry Trump supporters?”</span></p>
        <p><span>This isn’t the first time the Snopes.com writer has expressed anti-Trump sentiment on his Twitter page. In another tweet in which Emery links to an article that falsely attributes a quote to President-elect Trump, Emery states, “Incredibly, some people actually think they have to put words in Trump’s mouth to make him look bad.”</span></p>
        <p><span>Emery also retweeted an article by <em>New York</em> magazine that claimed President-elect Trump relied on lies to win during his campaign and that we now lived in a “post-truth” society. “Before long we’ll all have forgotten what it was like to live in the same universe; or maybe we already have,” Emery tweeted.</span></p>
        <p><span>Facebook believe that Emery, along with other Snopes writers, ABC News, and </span><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/12/16/flashback-weekly-standard-data-shows-politifact-has-it-out-for-republicans/"><span>Politifact</span></a><span> are impartial enough to label and silence what they believe to be “fake news” on social media. </span></p>
