                    <p>Google has released an interesting new mobile UI framework that allows you to release for both iOS and Android with one codebase. It's in beta, but looks very slick and has been in alpha for a while. I think it's worth playing around with. Sometimes a framework just fits how you think and if Flutter does that for you, it could be an incredible value. Maintaining two code bases sucks.</p>

                    <p>John explains why encapsulation matters and the drawbacks of ignoring encapsulation. He illustrates how this works by giving an example of a user upgrading to the pro version of your app. By encapsulating, you can protect your app from bugs when you make UI changes, among other things.</p>

                    <p>I've been working with a client on app install campaigns the last couple weeks and have found out a lot of interesting info. It's still crazy high to buy app installs and your monetization strategy needs to be laser focused in order to get an acceptable return on investment. If you don't have good data on your free to paid subscription conversion rate, you need to get it! I've also learned just how important it is to know your user demographics so you can choose which platforms will give you the best results.</p>

                    <p>Raising rates is a common thing freelance developers stress over. The longer you put it off, the more money you lose and the harder it is to get your rate to where it should be. Plus, there's uncertainty over how to approach current or long-time clients. Can they get a different rate? Should they? Graeme gives a few tips along with some key advice on why it's not so bad to lose clients.</p>
                    <p>The main thing I took away from this post was that if you consistently raise your rates, it keeps you where you should be and minimizes the effect on current clients.</p>
