                            <p>Graduation parties are a great way to commemorate the years of hard work teens and college co-eds devote to education. They’re also costly for mom and dad.</p>
                            <p>The average cost of a graduation party in 2013 was a whopping $1,200, according to Graduationparty.com; $700 of that was allocated for food. However that budget was based on Midwestern statistics, and parties in urban areas like New York City are thought to have a much higher price tag.</p>
                            <p>Thankfully, there are plenty of creative ways to trim a little grad party fat without sacrificing any of the fun or celebratory spirit.</p>
