  "excerpt": "From Yahoo: A photographer and Navy veteran is fighting back after a photo she posted to Facebook started an online backlash. Vanessa Hicks said she had no idea her photo would be considered controversial. The photo, from a military familyâ€™s newborn photo shoot, showed a newborn infant wrapped in an American flag held by his father, who was in his military uniform. Hicks, a Navy veteran herself and the wife of an active-duty Navy member, said her intention was to honor the flag as well as her clients, who wanted to incorporate their military service in the photo shoot.",
