                <p name="342d" id="342d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, I need to say something about this article: the reason I’m writing it infuriates me. Worse than installing CS 3 or Acrobat 7 ever did, and the former inspired comparisons to fecophile porn. I’m actually too mad to cuss. Well, not completely, but in this case, I don’t think the people I’m mad at are worth the creativity I try to put into profanity. This is about a brownfield of hypocrisy and viciously deliberate mischaracterization that “shame” cannot even come close to the shame those behind it should feel.</p>
                <p name="2e61" id="2e61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, read this post by Samantha Bielefeld: The Elephant in the Room. First, it is a well-written critical piece that raises a few points in a calm, rational, nonconfrontational fashion, exactly the kind of things the pushers of The Great Big Lie say we need more of, as opposed to the screaming that is the norm in such cases.</p>
                <p name="cd31" id="cd31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">…sorry, I should explain “The Great Big Lie”. There are several, but in this case, our <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">specific</em> instance of “The Great Big Lie” is about criticism. Over and over, you hear from the very people I am not going to be nice to in this that we need “better” criticsm. Instead of rage and anger, volume and vitriol, we need in-depth rational criticism, that isn’t personal or ad hominem. That it should focus on points, not people.</p>
                <p name="ae07" id="ae07" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">That, readers, is “The Big Lie”. It is a lie so big that if one ponders the reality of it, as I am going to, one wonders why anyone would believe it. It is a lie and it is one we should stop telling.</p>

                <p name="a02f" id="a02f" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Samantha’s points (I assume you read it, for you are smart people who know the importance of such things) are fairly clear:</p>
                <ol class="postList">
                    <li name="9213" id="9213" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">With the release of Overcast 2.0, a product Samantha actually likes, Marco Arment moved to a <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" data-href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">patronage model</a> that will probably be successful for him.</li>
                    <li name="dfa5" id="dfa5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Arment’s insistence that “<a href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" data-href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">anyone can do this</a>” while technically true, (anyone can in fact, implement this pricing model), also implies that “anyone” can have the kind of success that a developer with Marco’s history, financial status, and deep ties to the Apple News Web is expected to have. This is silly.</li>
                    <li name="e55d" id="e55d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Marco Arment occupies a fairly unique position in the Apple universe, (gained by hard work and no small talent), and because of that, benefits from a set of privileges that a new developer or even one that has been around for a long time, but isn’t, well, <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Marco</em>, not only don’t have, but have little chance of attaining anytime soon.</li>
                    <li name="35fb" id="35fb" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Marco has earned his success and is entitled to the benefits and privileges it brings, but he seems rather blind to all of that, and seems to still imagine himself as “two guys in a garage”. This is just not correct.</li>
                    <li name="38e2" id="38e2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">In addition, the benefits and privileges of the above ensure that by releasing Overcast 2 as a free app, with patronage pricing, he has, if not gutted, severely hurt the ability of folks actually selling their apps for an up-front price of not free to continue doing so. This has the effect of accelerating the “race to the bottom” in the podcast listening app segment, which hurts devs who cannot afford to work on a “I don’t really need this money, so whatever you feel like sending is okay” model.</li>
                </ol>
                <p name="0481" id="0481" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">None of this is incorrect. None of this is an ad hominem attack in any way. It is just pointing out that a developer of Arment’s stature and status lives in a very different world than someone in East Frog Balls, Arkansas trying to make a living off of App sales. Our dev in EFB doesn’t have the main sites on the Apple web falling all over themselves to review their app the way that Arment does. They’re not friends with the people being The Loop, Daring Fireball, SixColors, iMore, The Mac Observer, etc., yadda.</p>
                <p name="5a45" id="5a45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, our hero, in a fit of well-meaning ignorance writes this piece (posted this morning, 14 Oct. 15) and of course, the response and any criticisms are just as reasonable and thoughtful.</p>
                <p name="3bc7" id="3bc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you really believe that, you are the most preciously ignorant person in the world, and can I have your seriously charmed life.</p>

                <blockquote name="3271" id="3271" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I can see why you have some reservations about publishing it, but my gut feeling is that he would take it better than Nilay.</blockquote>
                <p name="ec72" id="ec72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Oh honey, bless your sweet, ignorant heart. Marco is one of the biggest pushers of The Big Lie, and one of the reasons it is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">such</em> a lie.</p>
                <p name="5cc4" id="5cc4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it gets better. First, you have the “hey, Marco <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">earned</em> his status!” lot. A valid point, and one Bielefeld explicitly acknowledges, here:</p>
                <blockquote name="4e5f" id="4e5f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">From his ground floor involvement in Tumblr (for which he is now a millionaire), to the creation and sale of a wildly successful app called Instapaper, he has become a household name in technology minded circles.

                <p name="cee9" id="cee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">and here:</p>
                <blockquote name="3f1b" id="3f1b" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I’m not knocking his success, he has put effort into his line of work, and has built his own life.</blockquote>

                <p name="8a01" id="8a01" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">But still, you get the people telling her something she already acknowledge:</p>
                <blockquote name="7685" id="7685" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I don’t think he’s blind. he’s worked to where he has gotten and has had failures like everyone else.</blockquote>
                <p name="b151" id="b151" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Thank you for restating something in the article. To the person who wrote it.</p>
                <p name="87bc" id="87bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the original article, Samantha talked about the money Marco makes from his podcast. She based that on the numbers <a href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" data-href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">provided by ATP in terms of sponsorship rates</a> and the number of current sponsors the podcast has. Is this going to yield perfect numbers? No. But the numbers you get from it will at least be reasonable, or should be unless the published sponsorship rates are just fantasy, and you’re stupid for taking them seriously.</p>
                <p name="dbda" id="dbda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At first, she went with a simple formula:</p>
                <blockquote name="1b4e" id="1b4e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">$4K x 3 per episode = $12K x 52 weeks / 3 hosts splitting it.</blockquote>
                <p name="0b33" id="0b33" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">That’s not someone making shit up, right? Rather quickly, someone pointed out that she’d made an error in how she calculated it:</p>
                <blockquote name="76d7" id="76d7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">That’s $4k per ad, no? So more like $12–16k per episode.</blockquote>
                <p name="a089" id="a089" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">She’d already realized her mistake and fixed it.</p>
                <blockquote name="b369" id="b369" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">which is actually wrong, and I’m correcting now. $4,000 per sponsor, per episode! So, $210,000 per year.</blockquote>
                <p name="8b3b" id="8b3b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Again, this is based on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">publicly available data</em> the only kind someone not part of ATP or a close friend of Arment has access to. So while her numbers may be wrong, if they are, there’s no way for her to know that. She’s basing her opinion on actual available data. Which is sadly rare.</p>
                <p name="135a" id="135a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This becomes a huge flashpoint. You name a reason to attack her over this, people do. No really. For example, she’s not calculating his <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">income taxes correctly</em>:</p>
                <blockquote name="5e7e" id="5e7e" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">especially since it isn’t his only source of income thus, not an indicator of his marginal inc. tax bracket.</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="6036" id="6036" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">thus, guessing net income is more haphazard than stating approx. gross income.</blockquote>
                <p name="aac1" id="aac1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Ye Gods. She’s not doing his taxes for him, her point is invalid?</p>
                <p name="600f" id="600f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then there’s the people who seem to have not read anything past what other people are telling them:</p>
                <blockquote name="9b62" id="9b62" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Not sure what to make of your Marco piece, to be honest. You mention his fame, whatever, but what’s the main idea here?</blockquote>
                <p name="c18a" id="c18a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Just how spoon-fed do you have to be? Have you no teeth?</p>
                <p name="c445" id="c445" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Of course, Marco jumps in, and predictably, he’s snippy:</p>
                <blockquote name="0c21" id="0c21" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">If you’re going to speak in precise absolutes, it’s best to first ensure that you’re correct.</blockquote>
                <p name="8f8d" id="8f8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you’re going to be like that, it’s best to provide better data. Don’t get snippy when someone is going off the only data available, and is clearly open to revising based on better data.</p>
                <p name="cc97" id="cc97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then Marco’s friends/fans get into it:</p>
                <blockquote name="f9da" id="f9da" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">I really don’t understand why it’s anyone’s business</blockquote>
                <p name="0094" id="0094" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Samantha is trying to qualify for sainthood at this point:</p>
                <blockquote name="0105" id="0105" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">It isn’t really, it was a way of putting his income in context in regards to his ability to gamble with Overcast.</blockquote>
                <p name="cdd1" id="cdd1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Again, she’s trying to drag people back to her actual point, but no one is going to play. The storm has begun. Then we get people who are just spouting nonsense:</p>
                <blockquote name="f56c" id="f56c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Why is that only relevant for him? It’s a pretty weird metric,especially since his apps aren’t free.</blockquote>
                <p name="4fef" id="4fef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Wha?? Overcast 2 is absolutely free. Samantha points this out:</p>
                <blockquote name="0f36" id="0f36" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">His app is free, that’s what sparked the article to begin with.</blockquote>
                <p name="40d2" id="40d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">The response is literally a parallel to “How can there be global warming if it snowed today in my town?”</p>

                <p name="7b13" id="7b13" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">She is still trying:</p>
                <blockquote name="44ba" id="44ba" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">You paid $4.99 to unlock functionality in Overcast 1.0 and you chose to support him with no additional functionality in 2.0</blockquote>

                <p name="5e6f" id="5e6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">She however, is relentless:</p>

                <p name="6134" id="6134" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">I would like to say I’m surprised at the reaction to Samantha’s article, but I’m not. In spite of his loud declarations of support for The Big Lie, Marco Arment is as bad at any form of criticism that he hasn’t already approved as a very insecure tween. An example from 2011: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9</a></p>
                <p name="ba3c" id="ba3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Marco is great with criticism as long as it never actually criticizes him. If it does, be prepared a flood of petty, petulant whining that a room full of bored preschoolers on a hot day would be hard-pressed to match.</p>
                <p name="a5a0" id="a5a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today has been…well, it sucks. It sucks because someone doing what all the Arments of the world claim to want was naive enough to believe what they were told, and found out the hard way just how big a lie The Big Lie is, and how vicious people are when you’re silly enough to believe anything they say about criticism.</p>
                <p name="2a25" id="2a25" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And note again, every single condescending crack, misrepresentation, and strawman had an exclusively male source. Most of them have, at one point or another, loudly trumpted themselves as Feminist Allies, as a friend to women struggling with the sexism and misogyny in tech. Congratulations y’all on being just as bad as the people you claim to oppose.</p>
                <p name="a47a" id="a47a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Samantha has handled this better than anyone else could have. My respect for her as a person and a writer is off the charts. If she choses to walk away from blogging in the Apple space, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">believe me</em> I understand. As bad as today was for her, I’ve seen worse. Much worse.</p>
                <p name="aa8e" id="aa8e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I hope she doesn’t. I hope she stays, because she is Doing This Right, and in a corner of the internet that has become naught but an endless circle jerk, a cliquish collection, a churlish, childish cohort interested not in writing or the truth, but in making sure The Right People are elevated, and The Others put down, she is someone worth reading and listening to. The number people who owe her apologies goes around the block, and I don’t think she’ll ever see a one. I’m sure as heck not apologizing for them, I’ll not make their lives easier in the least.</p>
                <p name="34c5" id="34c5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of you, all. of. you…Marco, Breen, Snell, Vittici, had a chance to live by your words. You were faced with reasoned, polite, respectful criticism and instead of what you should have done, you all dropped trou and sprayed an epic diarrheal discharge all over someone who had done nothing to deserve it. Me, I earned most of my aggro, Samantha did not earn any of the idiocy I’ve seen today. I hope you’re all proud of yourselves. Someone should be, it won’t be me. Ever.</p>
                <p name="9710" id="9710" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">So I hope she stays, but if she goes, I understand. For what it’s worth, I don’t think she’s wrong either way.</p>
