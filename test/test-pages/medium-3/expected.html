                <p name="c979" id="c979">(EDIT: removed the link to Samantha’s post, because the arments and the grubers and the rest of The Deck Clique got what they wanted: a non-proper person driven off the internet lightly capped with a dusting of transphobia along the way, all totally okay because the ends justify the means, and it’s okay when “good” people do it.)</p>
                <p name="342d" id="342d">First, I need to say something about this article: the reason I’m writing it infuriates me. Worse than installing CS 3 or Acrobat 7 ever did, and the former inspired comparisons to fecophile porn. I’m actually too mad to cuss. Well, not completely, but in this case, I don’t think the people I’m mad at are worth the creativity I try to put into profanity. This is about a brownfield of hypocrisy and viciously deliberate mischaracterization that “shame” cannot even come close to the shame those behind it should feel.</p>
                <p name="2e61" id="2e61">Now, read this post by Samantha Bielefeld: The Elephant in the Room. First, it is a well-written critical piece that raises a few points in a calm, rational, nonconfrontational fashion, exactly the kind of things the pushers of The Great Big Lie say we need more of, as opposed to the screaming that is the norm in such cases.</p>
                <p name="cd31" id="cd31">…sorry, I should explain “The Great Big Lie”. There are several, but in this case, our <em>specific</em> instance of “The Great Big Lie” is about criticism. Over and over, you hear from the very people I am not going to be nice to in this that we need “better” criticsm. Instead of rage and anger, volume and vitriol, we need in-depth rational criticism, that isn’t personal or ad hominem. That it should focus on points, not people.</p>
                <p name="ae07" id="ae07">That, readers, is “The Big Lie”. It is a lie so big that if one ponders the reality of it, as I am going to, one wonders why anyone would believe it. It is a lie and it is one we should stop telling.</p>

                <p name="a02f" id="a02f">Samantha’s points (I assume you read it, for you are smart people who know the importance of such things) are fairly clear:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li name="9213" id="9213">With the release of Overcast 2.0, a product Samantha actually likes, Marco Arment moved to a <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" data-href="http://www.marco.org/2015/10/09/overcast2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">patronage model</a> that will probably be successful for him.</li>
                    <li name="dfa5" id="dfa5">Arment’s insistence that “<a href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" data-href="https://medium.com/@marcoarment/pragmatic-app-pricing-a79fc07218f3" target="_blank">anyone can do this</a>” while technically true, (anyone can in fact, implement this pricing model), also implies that “anyone” can have the kind of success that a developer with Marco’s history, financial status, and deep ties to the Apple News Web is expected to have. This is silly.</li>
                    <li name="e55d" id="e55d">Marco Arment occupies a fairly unique position in the Apple universe, (gained by hard work and no small talent), and because of that, benefits from a set of privileges that a new developer or even one that has been around for a long time, but isn’t, well, <em>Marco</em>, not only don’t have, but have little chance of attaining anytime soon.</li>
                    <li name="35fb" id="35fb">Marco has earned his success and is entitled to the benefits and privileges it brings, but he seems rather blind to all of that, and seems to still imagine himself as “two guys in a garage”. This is just not correct.</li>
                    <li name="38e2" id="38e2">In addition, the benefits and privileges of the above ensure that by releasing Overcast 2 as a free app, with patronage pricing, he has, if not gutted, severely hurt the ability of folks actually selling their apps for an up-front price of not free to continue doing so. This has the effect of accelerating the “race to the bottom” in the podcast listening app segment, which hurts devs who cannot afford to work on a “I don’t really need this money, so whatever you feel like sending is okay” model.</li>
                </ol>
                <p name="0481" id="0481">None of this is incorrect. None of this is an ad hominem attack in any way. It is just pointing out that a developer of Arment’s stature and status lives in a very different world than someone in East Frog Balls, Arkansas trying to make a living off of App sales. Our dev in EFB doesn’t have the main sites on the Apple web falling all over themselves to review their app the way that Arment does. They’re not friends with the people being The Loop, Daring Fireball, SixColors, iMore, The Mac Observer, etc., yadda.</p>
                <p name="5a45" id="5a45">So, our hero, in a fit of well-meaning ignorance writes this piece (posted this morning, 14 Oct. 15) and of course, the response and any criticisms are just as reasonable and thoughtful.</p>
                <p name="3bc7" id="3bc7">If you really believe that, you are the most preciously ignorant person in the world, and can I have your seriously charmed life.</p>

            <div>
                <p name="0fb2" id="0fb2">The response, from all quarters, including Marco, someone who is so sensitive to criticism that the word “useless” is <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/03/30/here-is-a-tip-for-all-the-non-developers-out" data-href="http://www.marco.org/2011/03/30/here-is-a-tip-for-all-the-non-developers-out" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">enough to shut him down</a>, who <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/641330113934700544" data-href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/641330113934700544" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blocked a friend of mine for the high crime of pointing out that his review of podcasting mics centered around higher priced gear and ignored folks without the scratch, who might not be ready for such things</a>, is, in a single word, disgusting. Vomitous even.</p>
                <p name="9a6e" id="9a6e">It’s an hours-long dogpile that beggars even my imagination, and I can imagine almost anything. Seriously, it’s all there in <a href="https://twitter.com/s_bielefeld/with_replies" data-href="https://twitter.com/s_bielefeld/with_replies" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Samantha’s Twitter Feed</a>. From what I can tell, she’s understandably shocked over it. I however was not. This one comment in her feed made me smile (warning, this wanders a bit…er…LOT. Twitter timelines are not easy to put together):</p>
                <blockquote name="3271" id="3271">I can see why you have some reservations about publishing it, but my gut feeling is that he would take it better than Nilay.</blockquote>
                <p name="ec72" id="ec72">Oh honey, bless your sweet, ignorant heart. Marco is one of the biggest pushers of The Big Lie, and one of the reasons it is <em>such</em> a lie.</p>
                <p name="5cc4" id="5cc4">But it gets better. First, you have the “hey, Marco <em>earned</em> his status!” lot. A valid point, and one Bielefeld explicitly acknowledges, here:</p>
                <blockquote name="4e5f" id="4e5f">From his ground floor involvement in Tumblr (for which he is now a millionaire), to the creation and sale of a wildly successful app called Instapaper, he has become a household name in technology minded circles. It is this extensive time spent in the spotlight, the huge following on Twitter, and dedicated listeners of his weekly aired Accidental Tech Podcast, that has granted him the freedom to break from seeking revenue in more traditional manners.</blockquote>
                <p name="cee9" id="cee9">and here:</p>
                <blockquote name="3f1b" id="3f1b">I’m not knocking his success, he has put effort into his line of work, and has built his own life.</blockquote>
                <p name="e527" id="e527">and here:</p>
                <blockquote name="3e4f" id="3e4f">He has earned his time in the spotlight, and it’s only natural for him to take advantage of it.</blockquote>
                <p name="8a01" id="8a01">But still, you get the people telling her something she already acknowledge:</p>
                <blockquote name="7685" id="7685">I don’t think he’s blind. he’s worked to where he has gotten and has had failures like everyone else.</blockquote>
                <p name="b151" id="b151">Thank you for restating something in the article. To the person who wrote it.</p>
                <p name="87bc" id="87bc">In the original article, Samantha talked about the money Marco makes from his podcast. She based that on the numbers <a href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" data-href="http://atp.fm/sponsor/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">provided by ATP in terms of sponsorship rates</a> and the number of current sponsors the podcast has. Is this going to yield perfect numbers? No. But the numbers you get from it will at least be reasonable, or should be unless the published sponsorship rates are just fantasy, and you’re stupid for taking them seriously.</p>
                <p name="dbda" id="dbda">At first, she went with a simple formula:</p>
                <blockquote name="1b4e" id="1b4e">$4K x 3 per episode = $12K x 52 weeks / 3 hosts splitting it.</blockquote>
                <p name="0b33" id="0b33">That’s not someone making shit up, right? Rather quickly, someone pointed out that she’d made an error in how she calculated it:</p>
                <blockquote name="76d7" id="76d7">That’s $4k per ad, no? So more like $12–16k per episode.</blockquote>
                <p name="a089" id="a089">She’d already realized her mistake and fixed it.</p>
                <blockquote name="b369" id="b369">which is actually wrong, and I’m correcting now. $4,000 per sponsor, per episode! So, $210,000 per year.</blockquote>
                <p name="8b3b" id="8b3b">Again, this is based on <em>publicly available data</em> the only kind someone not part of ATP or a close friend of Arment has access to. So while her numbers may be wrong, if they are, there’s no way for her to know that. She’s basing her opinion on actual available data. Which is sadly rare.</p>
                <p name="135a" id="135a">This becomes a huge flashpoint. You name a reason to attack her over this, people do. No really. For example, she’s not calculating his <em>income taxes correctly</em>:</p>
                <blockquote name="5e7e" id="5e7e">especially since it isn’t his only source of income thus, not an indicator of his marginal inc. tax bracket.</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="6036" id="6036">thus, guessing net income is more haphazard than stating approx. gross income.</blockquote>
                <p name="aac1" id="aac1">Ye Gods. She’s not doing his taxes for him, her point is invalid?</p>
                <p name="600f" id="600f">Then there’s the people who seem to have not read anything past what other people are telling them:</p>
                <blockquote name="9b62" id="9b62">Not sure what to make of your Marco piece, to be honest. You mention his fame, whatever, but what’s the main idea here?</blockquote>
                <p name="c18a" id="c18a">Just how spoon-fed do you have to be? Have you no teeth?</p>
                <p name="c445" id="c445">Of course, Marco jumps in, and predictably, he’s snippy:</p>
                <blockquote name="0c21" id="0c21">If you’re going to speak in precise absolutes, it’s best to first ensure that you’re correct.</blockquote>
                <p name="8f8d" id="8f8d">If you’re going to be like that, it’s best to provide better data. Don’t get snippy when someone is going off the only data available, and is clearly open to revising based on better data.</p>
                <p name="cc97" id="cc97">Then Marco’s friends/fans get into it:</p>
                <blockquote name="f9da" id="f9da">I really don’t understand why it’s anyone’s business</blockquote>
                <p name="0094" id="0094">Samantha is trying to qualify for sainthood at this point:</p>
                <blockquote name="0105" id="0105">It isn’t really, it was a way of putting his income in context in regards to his ability to gamble with Overcast.</blockquote>
                <p name="cdd1" id="cdd1">Again, she’s trying to drag people back to her actual point, but no one is going to play. The storm has begun. Then we get people who are just spouting nonsense:</p>
                <blockquote name="f56c" id="f56c">Why is that only relevant for him? It’s a pretty weird metric,especially since his apps aren’t free.</blockquote>
                <p name="4fef" id="4fef">Wha?? Overcast 2 is absolutely free. Samantha points this out:</p>
                <blockquote name="0f36" id="0f36">His app is free, that’s what sparked the article to begin with.</blockquote>
                <p name="40d2" id="40d2">The response is literally a parallel to “How can there be global warming if it snowed today in my town?”</p>
                <blockquote name="6760" id="6760">If it’s free, how have I paid for it? Twice?</blockquote>
                <p name="7b13" id="7b13">She is still trying:</p>
                <blockquote name="44ba" id="44ba">You paid $4.99 to unlock functionality in Overcast 1.0 and you chose to support him with no additional functionality in 2.0</blockquote>
                <p name="2152" id="2152">He is having none of it. IT SNOWED! SNOWWWWWWW!</p>
                <blockquote name="99a6" id="99a6">Yes. That’s not free. Free is when you choose not to make money. And that can be weaponized. But that’s not what Overcast does.</blockquote>
                <p name="5e6f" id="5e6f">She however, is relentless:</p>
                <blockquote name="1b0f" id="1b0f">No, it’s still free. You can choose to support it, you are required to pay $4.99 for Pocket Casts. Totally different model.</blockquote>
                <p name="d24f" id="d24f">Dude seems to give up. (Note: allllll the people bagging on her are men. All of them. Mansplaining like hell. And I’d bet every one of them considers themselves a feminist.)</p>
                <p name="10e1" id="10e1">We get another guy trying to push the narrative she’s punishing him for his success, which is just…it’s stupid, okay? Stupid.</p>
                <blockquote name="9b01" id="9b01">It also wasn’t my point in writing my piece today, but it seems to be everyone’s focus.</blockquote>
                <p name="340c" id="340c">(UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE YEAR)</p>
                <blockquote name="7244" id="7244">I think the focus should be more on that fact that while it’s difficult, Marco spent years building his audience.</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="ffb1" id="ffb1">It doesn’t matter what he makes it how he charges. If the audience be earned is willing to pay for it, awesome.</blockquote>
                <p name="e44e" id="e44e">She tries, oh lord, she tries:</p>
                <blockquote name="a502" id="a502">To assert that he isn’t doing anything any other dev couldn’t, is wrong. It’s successful because it’s Marco.</blockquote>
                <p name="7dcd" id="7dcd">But no, HE KNOWS HER POINT BETTER THAN SHE DOES:</p>
                <blockquote name="a62a" id="a62a">No, it’s successful because he busted his ass to make it so. It’s like any other business. He grew it.</blockquote>
                <p name="df8c" id="df8c">Christ. This is like a field of strawmen. Stupid ones. Very stupid ones.</p>
                <p name="521a" id="521a">One guy tries to blame it all on Apple, another in a string of Wha??? moments:</p>
                <blockquote name="d80d" id="d80d">the appropriate context is Apple’s App Store policies. Other devs aren’t Marco’s responsibility</blockquote>
                <p name="db0b" id="db0b">Seriously? Dude, are you even trying to talk about what Samantha actually wrote? At this point, Samantha is clearly mystified at the entire thing:</p>
                <blockquote name="7a78" id="7a78">Why has the conversation suddenly turned to focus on nothing more than ATP sponsorship income?</blockquote>
                <p name="6e09" id="6e09">Because it’s a nit they can pick and allows them to ignore everything you wrote. That’s the only reason.</p>
                <p name="b7db" id="b7db">One guy is “confused”:</p>
                <blockquote name="3626" id="3626">I see. He does have clout, so are you saying he’s too modest in how he sees himself as a dev?</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="9daa" id="9daa">Yes. He can’t be equated to the vast majority of other developers. Like calling Gruber, “just another blogger”.</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="f6da" id="f6da">Alright, that’s fair. I was just confused by the $ and fame angle at first.</blockquote>
                <p name="d5b1" id="d5b1">Samantha’s point centers on the benefits Marco gains via his fame and background. <em>HOW DO YOU NOT MENTION THAT? HOW IS THAT CONFUSING?</em></p>
                <p name="58d0" id="58d0">People of course are telling her it’s her fault for mentioning a salient fact at all:</p>
                <blockquote name="30d2" id="30d2">Why has the conversation suddenly turned to focus on nothing more than ATP sponsorship income?</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="765b" id="765b">Maybe because you went there with your article?</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="61fe" id="61fe">As a way of rationalizing his ability to gamble with the potential for Overcast to generate income…not the norm at all.</blockquote>
                <p name="f17c" id="f17c">Of course, had she not brought up those important points, she’d have been bagged on for “not providing proof”. Lose some, lose more. By now, she’s had enough and she just deletes all mention of it. Understandable, but sad she was bullied into doing that.</p>
                <p name="0b60" id="0b60">Yes, bullied. That’s all this is. Bullying. She didn’t lie, cheat, or exaagerate. If her numbers were wrong, they weren’t wrong in a way she had any ability to do anything about. But there’s blood in the water, and the comments and attacks get worse:</p>
                <blockquote name="65ab" id="65ab">Because you decided to start a conversation about someone else’s personal shit. You started this war.</blockquote>
                <p name="1adb" id="1adb">War. THIS. IS. WAR.</p>
                <p name="de94" id="de94">This is a bunch of nerds attacking someone for reasoned, calm, <em>polite</em> criticism of their friend/idol. Samantha is politely pushing back a bit:</p>
                <blockquote name="4458" id="4458">That doesn’t explain why every other part of my article is being pushed aside.</blockquote>
                <p name="aeac" id="aeac">She’s right. This is all nonsense. This is people ignoring her article completely, just looking for things to attack so it can be dismissed. It’s tribalism at its purest.</p>
                <p name="0078" id="0078">Then some of the other annointed get into it, including Jason Snell in one of the most spectactular displays of “I have special knowledge you can’t be expected to have, therefore you are totally off base and wrong, even though there’s no way for you to know this” I’ve seen in a while. Jason:</p>
                <blockquote name="c4c9" id="c4c9">You should never use an ad rate card to estimate ad revenue from any media product ever.</blockquote>
                <blockquote name="b66b" id="b66b">I learned this when I started working for a magazine — rate cards are mostly fiction, like prices on new cars</blockquote>
                <p name="6907" id="6907">How…exactly…in the name of whatever deity Jason may believe in…is Samantha or anyone not “in the biz” supposed to know this. Also, what exactly does a magazine on paper like Macworld have to do with sponsorships for a podcast? I have done podcasts that were sponsored, and I can retaliate with “we charged what the rate card said we did. <em>Checkmate Elitests!</em>”</p>
                <p name="41ec" id="41ec">Samantha basically abases herself at his feet:</p>
                <blockquote name="0b14" id="0b14">I understand my mistake, and it’s unfortunate that it has completely diluted the point of my article.</blockquote>
                <p name="590f" id="590f">I think she should have told him where and how to stuff that nonsense, but she’s a nicer person than I am. Also, it’s appropriate that Jason’s twitter avatar has its nose in the air. This is some rank snobbery. It’s disgusting and if anyone pulled that on him, Jason would be very upset. But hey, one cannot criticize The Marco without getting pushback. By “pushback”, I mean “an unrelenting fecal flood”.</p>
                <p name="69dc" id="69dc">Her only mistake was criticizing one of the Kool Kids. Folks, if you criticize anyone in The Deck Clique, or their friends, expect the same thing, regardless of tone or point.</p>
                <p name="5ab4" id="5ab4">Another App Dev, seemingly unable to parse Samantha’s words, needs <em>more</em> explanation:</p>
                <blockquote name="957b" id="957b">so just looking over your mentions, I’m curious what exactly was your main point? Ignoring the podcast income bits.</blockquote>
                <p name="0a7e" id="0a7e">Oh wait, he didn’t even read the article. Good on you, Dev Guy, good. on. you. Still, she plays nice <em>with someone who didn’t even read her article</em>:</p>
                <blockquote name="f7db" id="f7db">That a typical unknown developer can’t depend on patronage to generate revenue, and charging for apps will become a negative.</blockquote>
                <p name="937f" id="937f">Marco comes back of course, and now basically accuses her of lying about other devs talking to her and supporting her point:</p>

                <p name="6134" id="6134">I would like to say I’m surprised at the reaction to Samantha’s article, but I’m not. In spite of his loud declarations of support for The Big Lie, Marco Arment is as bad at any form of criticism that he hasn’t already approved as a very insecure tween. An example from 2011: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-arment-2011-9</a></p>
                <p name="ba3c" id="ba3c">Marco is great with criticism as long as it never actually criticizes him. If it does, be prepared a flood of petty, petulant whining that a room full of bored preschoolers on a hot day would be hard-pressed to match.</p>
                <p name="a5a0" id="a5a0">Today has been…well, it sucks. It sucks because someone doing what all the Arments of the world claim to want was naive enough to believe what they were told, and found out the hard way just how big a lie The Big Lie is, and how vicious people are when you’re silly enough to believe anything they say about criticism.</p>
                <p name="2a25" id="2a25">And note again, every single condescending crack, misrepresentation, and strawman had an exclusively male source. Most of them have, at one point or another, loudly trumpted themselves as Feminist Allies, as a friend to women struggling with the sexism and misogyny in tech. Congratulations y’all on being just as bad as the people you claim to oppose.</p>
                <p name="a47a" id="a47a">Samantha has handled this better than anyone else could have. My respect for her as a person and a writer is off the charts. If she choses to walk away from blogging in the Apple space, <em>believe me</em> I understand. As bad as today was for her, I’ve seen worse. Much worse.</p>
                <p name="aa8e" id="aa8e">But I hope she doesn’t. I hope she stays, because she is Doing This Right, and in a corner of the internet that has become naught but an endless circle jerk, a cliquish collection, a churlish, childish cohort interested not in writing or the truth, but in making sure The Right People are elevated, and The Others put down, she is someone worth reading and listening to. The number people who owe her apologies goes around the block, and I don’t think she’ll ever see a one. I’m sure as heck not apologizing for them, I’ll not make their lives easier in the least.</p>
                <p name="34c5" id="34c5">All of you, all. of. you…Marco, Breen, Snell, Vittici, had a chance to live by your words. You were faced with reasoned, polite, respectful criticism and instead of what you should have done, you all dropped trou and sprayed an epic diarrheal discharge all over someone who had done nothing to deserve it. Me, I earned most of my aggro, Samantha did not earn any of the idiocy I’ve seen today. I hope you’re all proud of yourselves. Someone should be, it won’t be me. Ever.</p>
                <p name="9710" id="9710">So I hope she stays, but if she goes, I understand. For what it’s worth, I don’t think she’s wrong either way.</p>
