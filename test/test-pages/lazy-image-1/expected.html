We have a lot of challenges with performance, availability, and scalability because of the insane amount of traffic our infrastructure supports (billions of events/requests per day …… no joke!). In this setting, every metric is important and gives us a lot of information about the state of our system. </p>
            <p id="0e89"> When working with Node.js one of the most critical resources to monitor is the CPU. Most of the time, when working on a low traffic API or project we don’t realize how many simple lines of code can have a huge impact on CPU. On the other hand, when traffic increases, a simple mistake can cost dearly. </p>
            <p id="1efa"> What kind of resources does your application need? In most cases, we focus on memory and CPU. Good monitoring of these two elements is mandatory for an application running on production. </p>
            <p id="dce9"> For memory, constant monitoring is the best practice to track the worst developer nightmare a.k.a memory leak. </p>

            <p id="e1ad"> With the inspector module, you can do much more than just CPU profiling, here is a non-exhaustive list: </p>

                <li id="eb04">memory dump &amp; memory sampling </li>

            </ul>
            <p id="731b"> Every tool, even the most powerful, comes with its own disadvantages. If you enable the profiler and/or the debugger on your production you have to keep an eye on two things: </p>
            <p id="e485">
                <strong>1) performance overhead</strong>
            </p>
            <p id="0513"> A profiler needs to use CPU to work and it collects data into memory. The longer you let it run and the more CPU / memory it will need. This is why you should begin with very short CPU profiling, no more than a few seconds between the start and stop command. And never forget to monitor the impact of the profiler on your own infrastructure. If everything is fine you can increase the time and the frequency of CPU profiling. </p>
            <p id="049c"> One more very important thing: <strong>never forget to always stop a started CPU profiling</strong>. You can add a timer to automatically call the stop function after a while. </p>
            <p id="0656">
                <strong>2) security</strong>
            </p>
            <p id="7999"> Using the inspector in Node.js it’s like opening the door of the core of your application. You should be very careful about who can use features like CPU profiling and/or the debugger. Never make the inspector “public” as being able to launch a feature from an unsafe route (not protected with an authentification mechanism). Even the collected data can be seen as critical, never send it to a system you do not trust. </p>
            <p id="ae1a"> CPU profiling is really a must-have tool for every developer. And now, with some precautions, we can run it on production thanks to the amazing work done by the V8 and Node.js team. </p>
            <p id="1eab"> The inspector module offers a lot more features than you can use to debug your application. </p>
            <p id="0aba"> I will write another article about using CPU profiling and the inspector on production on a high traffic project. </p>
