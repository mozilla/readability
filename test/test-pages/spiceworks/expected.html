        <h2> Video is the Ultimate Engagement Tool for Marketers in 2020 </h2>
        <p> With people confined to their homes for the last three to four months, our social lives have moved online, and video consumption has risen notably within the at-home segments of television, gaming, education, OTT, and business content. </p>
        <p> Consumer behavior is rapidly evolving as the world adjusts to the new normal. The emergence of trends, such as social distancing, work-from-home, and virtual meetings have increased the demand for at-home digital media. </p>
        <p> Video platforms like Vidyard are looking to accelerate consumer habit-formation through the ease of access and intuitive interfaces. What does this mean for marketers? It is no secret that videos are the most engaging tool available to marketers today. However, barriers such as video production, screen recording, and easy sharing had traditionally prevented marketers from unlocking the real potential of digital videos. </p>
        <p> With the introduction of smart video platforms, marketers can leverage the format to not only engage customers and drive sales, but also share access with other business functions within the organization, like HR and finance, who can also use it as an employee-facing tool. </p>
