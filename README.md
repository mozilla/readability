# Readability.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/readability.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/readability)

A standalone version of the readability library used for Firefox Reader View. Any changes to Readability.js itself should be reviewed by an [appropriate Firefox/toolkit peer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox), such as [@gijsk](https://github.com/gijsk), since these changes will be automatically merged to mozilla-central.

## Contributing

For outstanding issues, see the issue list in this repo, as well as this [bug list](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?component=Reader%20Mode&product=Toolkit&bug_status=__open__&limit=0).

To test local changes to Readability.js, you can use the [automated tests](#tests). There's a [node script](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/master/test/generate-testcase.js) to help you create new ones.

Note that because `JSDOMParser` is restricted to parsing XHTML-compatible input, you will likely need to tweak any input you fetch directly from the internet (e.g. to close `<meta>` tags). Even if creating a 'readable' version fails, the script will leave the input for you to change. You can then re-run the `generate-testcase.js` script passing only the test page slug, and it will reuse the altered input. Ideally we should fix the `generate-testcase.js` script to no longer need this manual pre/post-processing. If you have time to help with this, a pull request would be very welcome!

Please make sure to run [eslint](http://eslint.org/) against any proposed changes when creating a pull request.

## Usage

To parse a document, you must create a new `Readability` object from a URI object and a document object, and then call `parse()`. Here's an example:

```javascript
var loc = document.location;
var uri = {
  spec: loc.href,
  host: loc.host,
  prePath: loc.protocol + "//" + loc.host,
  scheme: loc.protocol.substr(0, loc.protocol.indexOf(":")),
  pathBase: loc.protocol + "//" + loc.host + loc.pathname.substr(0, loc.pathname.lastIndexOf("/") + 1)
};
var article = new Readability(uri, document).parse();
```

This `article` object will contain the following properties:

* `uri`: original `uri` object that was passed to constructor
* `title`: article title
* `content`: HTML string of processed article content
* `length`: length of article, in characters
* `excerpt`: article description, or short excerpt from content
* `byline`: author metadata
* `dir`: content direction

If you're using Readability on the web, you will likely be able to use a `document` reference from elsewhere (e.g. fetched via XMLHttpRequest, in a same-origin `<iframe>` you have access to, etc.). Otherwise, you would need to construct such an object using a DOM parser such as [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). While this repository contains a parser of its own (`JSDOMParser`), that is restricted to reading XML-compatible markup and therefore we do not recommend it for general use.

Until [#346](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/issues/346) is fixed, if you're using `jsdom` and `node` (rather than running in a browser), you will need to also ensure a global `Node` object is available for `Readability` to use, e.g. like so:

```javascript
...
var dom = new JSDOM(html, OPTIONS);
Node = dom.window.Node;
var article = new Readability(uri, dom.window.document).parse();
```

### Optional

Readability's `parse()` works by modifying the DOM. This removes some elements in the web page. You could avoid this by passing the clone of the `document` object while creating a `Readability` object.


```
var documentClone = document.cloneNode(true); 
var article = new Readability(uri, documentClone).parse();   
```

## Tests

Please run [eslint](http://eslint.org/) as a first check that your changes adhere to our style guidelines.

To run the test suite:

    $ mocha test/test-*.js

To run a specific test page by its name:

    $ mocha test/test-*.js -g 001

To run the test suite in TDD mode:

    $ mocha test/test-*.js -w

Combo time:

    $ mocha test/test-*.js -w -g 001

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks for all test pages:

    $ npm run perf

Reference benchmark:

    $ npm run perf-reference
