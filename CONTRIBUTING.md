# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to help make `readability` better!

For outstanding issues, see the issue list in this repo, as well as this [bug list](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?component=Reader%20Mode&product=Toolkit&bug_status=__open__&limit=0).

Any changes to the main code should be reviewed by an [appropriate Firefox/toolkit peer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Modules/Firefox), such as [@gijsk](https://github.com/gijsk), since these changes will be merged to mozilla-central and shipped in Firefox.

To test local changes to Readability.js, you can use the [automated tests](#tests).

## Tests

[![Build Status](https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/github/v1/repository/mozilla/readability/main/badge.svg)](https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/api/github/v1/repository/mozilla/readability/main/latest)

Please run [eslint](http://eslint.org/) as a first check that your changes are valid JS and adhere to our style guidelines:

    $ npm run lint


To run the test suite:

    $ npm test

To run a specific test page by its name:

    $ npm test -- -g 001

To run the test suite in TDD mode:

    $ npm test -- -w

Combo time:

    $ npm test -- -w -g 001

### Add new tests

There's a [node script](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/master/test/generate-testcase.js) to help you create new tests.
You can run it using:

    $ node test/generate-testcase.js slug https://example.com/article

Replacing `slug` with the identifier the test should use, and providing a URL
to an actual article on which the test should be based. If your test case involves dynamic content, you can save the page to disk and pass the file as a `file://` URL.

On macOS, you may need to make the `tidy` binary executable before that script will succeed. If you see an `EACCES` error when running that script, try:

    $ chmod +x ./node_modules/htmltidy2/bin/darwin/tidy

## Pull Requests

We're always happy to see pull requests to improve readability.

Please ensure you run the linter and [tests](#tests) before submitting a PR.

If you're changing the algorithm to fix a specific page/article, please
[add new tests](#add-new-tests) for the case you're fixing, so we avoid
breaking it in future.

## Steps to release

1. Ensure [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) is up-to-date. ``git log `npm view . version`...master `` may help with this.
2. Run `npm run release` to create a release, which should:
     1. `npm version [patch | minor | major]`, depending on the nature of the changes according to
[semver](https://semver.org/). This will bump the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
and create a commit and Git tag for the release.
     2. `npm publish` to push the release to the npm registry.
     3. `git push origin head --follow-tags` to push the new commit and tag to GitHub.

## Keeping a changelog

Ensure significant changes are added to `CHANGELOG.md`. Do not add
changes that only affect tests or documentation.
